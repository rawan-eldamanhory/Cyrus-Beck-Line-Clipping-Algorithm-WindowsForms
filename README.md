# Cyrus–Beck Line Clipping Algorithm

This project demonstrates the **Cyrus–Beck line clipping algorithm**
using **C# Windows Forms**.

## 📐 Algorithm Overview
Cyrus–Beck is a parametric line clipping algorithm designed to clip
a line segment against a **convex polygon**.

The algorithm uses:
- Parametric line representation
- Dot products
- Entering (tL) and Leaving (tU) parameters

## 🎨 Visualization
- **Black polygon**: clipping window (convex)
- **Black line**: original line
- **Red line**: clipped line segment

## 🧮 Key Concepts
- Convex polygon edges
- Normal vectors
- Parametric intersection calculation
- Line rejection when tL > tU

## 🛠 Technologies
- C#
- Windows Forms
- GDI+

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Open the solution in Visual Studio
2. Build and run the project
3. Observe how the line is clipped against a convex polygon

## 📚 Educational Purpose
This project is intended for learning and visualizing advanced
computer graphics clipping algorithms.
